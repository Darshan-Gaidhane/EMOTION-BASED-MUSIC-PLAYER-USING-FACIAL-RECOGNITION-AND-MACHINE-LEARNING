# emotion-based-music-player-using-facial-recognition-and-machine-learning
The human face is an important part of an individual's body and it especially plays an
important role in knowing an individual's mood. Manually segregating the list of songs and
generating an appropriate playlist based on an individualâ€˜s emotional features is a very tedious,
time consuming, labour intensive and upheld task. Extracting the required input from the
human face can now be done directly using a camera. This project focuses on creating an
application to suggest songs for user based on their mood by capturing facial expressions.
Facial expression is a form of nonverbal communication. OpenCV software and Haar Cascade
Classifier is used to implement facial recognition algorithms. Using TensorFlow backend keras
model is used to detect emotion.
